    "Currency Introduction": [
      "The concept of Bitcoin (BitCoin) was originally proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. According to Satoshi's ideas, the open source software was designed and released and the P2P network was constructed. Bitcoin is a digital currency in the form of P2P. Peer-to-peer transmission means a decentralized payment system. Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on specific currency institutions to issue it. It is generated through a large number of calculations based on specific algorithms. The Bitcoin economy uses a distributed database composed of many nodes in the entire P2P network to confirm and record all transaction behaviors. And use the design of cryptography to ensure the security of all aspects of currency circulation. The decentralized nature of P2P and the algorithm itself can ensure that it is impossible to artificially manipulate the value of coins by making a large number of Bitcoins. Cryptography-based design allows Bitcoin to be transferred or paid only by its true owner. This also ensures the anonymity of currency ownership and circulation transactions. The biggest difference between Bitcoin and other virtual currencies is that its total number is very limited and it is extremely scarce. The currency system used to be no more than 10.5 million in 4 years, and the total number will be permanently limited to 21 million. "

      'Litecoin Litecoin (abbreviation: LTC, currency symbol: Ł) is an online currency based on "peer-to-peer" technology and is an open source software project under the MIT / X11 license. It can help users make instant payments to anyone in the world. Litecoin is inspired by Bitcoin (BTC) and has the same technical implementation principles. The creation and transfer of Litecoin is based on an open source encryption protocol and is not managed by any central authority. Litecoin aims to improve Bitcoin, compared to Litecoin with three significant differences. First, the Litecoin network can process a block every 2.5 minutes (instead of 10 minutes), so it can provide faster transaction confirmation. Second, the Litecoin network is expected to produce 84 million Litecoins, which is four times the amount of money issued by the Bitcoin network. Third, Litecoin uses the scrypt encryption algorithm first proposed by Colin Percival in its proof-of-work algorithm, which makes it easier to mine Litecoin on ordinary computers compared to Bitcoin. Each Litecoin is divided into 100,000,000 smaller units, defined by eight decimal places. '

Ripple's operating company is Ripple Labs (formerly known as OpenCoin). Ripple is the only universal currency in the ripple system. It is different from other currencies in the ripple system. Other currencies such as CNY and USD cannot be withdrawn across the gateway. In other words, the CNY issued by A gateway can only be withdrawn at A gateway. If you want to withdraw at B gateway, you must use the ripple system's pending order function to convert to CNY at B gateway before you can withdraw at B gateway. Ripple does not have this limitation at all. It is universal in the ripple system. Ripple (XRP), like Bitcoin, is a digital currency based on mathematics and cryptography, but unlike Bitcoin, there is no real purpose for it. XRP has a major bridge currency and secure security functions in the Ripple system. The function is indispensable, which requires that the gateways participating in this protocol must hold a small amount of XRP. "

In order to recover investor assets, the Ethereum community finally made a vote, and most of the participants agreed to change the Ethereum code and hope to recover the funds. For this reason, Ethereum made a hard fork and made a backward incompatible change, so that all Ethereum, including those occupied by hackers, returned to their original location. Since the hard fork was conducted publicly through the blockchain, although there are objections, as more and more people support the hard fork, on July 21, 2016, the Ethereum hard fork success. Currently, the 'official' version of Ethereum, ETH, is maintained by its original developers; Ethereum Classic ETC is maintained by a brand new team. This is the first time that the mainstream blockchain has changed its transaction records through a fork in order to compensate investors. People who held Ethereum before the fork will hold both ETH and ETC after the fork. Ethereum stored in exchanges or online wallets is no exception. The two markets derived from the fork have a total value of more than $ 1.2 billion. At present, more and more Ethereum miners have invested a lot of computing power into this classic blockchain, and the ETC transaction volume has risen, not only because of conceptual conformity, but also because they have seen to protect the security of transactions and win related mining. The value of the mine reward. The data a day or two after the launch of Ethereum Classic is impressive. The hash rate of its network is 544GH / s, which accounts for 13% of the total hashrate of the Ethereum network. "

Cardano is not only a cryptocurrency, but a technology platform that runs financial applications used by individuals, organizations and governments around the world on a daily basis. The platform is being layered, making the system easier to maintain and allowing upgrades via soft forks. After the construction of the settlement layer running Ada is completed, the computing layer will be separately constructed to process smart contracts. These digital legal agreements will support future business and operations. Cardano will also run decentralized applications or Dapps, and services will not be controlled by either party, but will operate on a blockchain basis. This is the first blockchain project developed from the philosophy of science and the only project designed and manufactured by a global team of leading academics and engineers. It is critical that technology is secure, flexible, and scalable, and available to millions of users. As a result, the thoughtfulness and concern of some leading experts have been invested in the project, and design decisions have been made. Scientific rigor applied to mission-critical systems such as aerospace science and banking has been derived into the field of cryptocurrencies and a high degree of security is implemented. We believe this is unprecedented. A major innovation of Cardano is the ability to bridge the balance between users and regulatory needs, and further integrate privacy and regulation. Cardano's vision is that by providing fair financial services to all, its new type of controlled computing will bring more financing inclusiveness. "

      `The Polkadot community voted to pass the DOT split 100 times plan. This is a DOT that has been split 100 times.
      Polkadot will realize a completely decentralized Internet, where users have complete control. It conceives that the Internet is that everyone’s identity and data are controlled by themselves – without being affected by any central agency.
      Polkadot aims to connect private chains, consortium chains, public chains, open networks and oracles, as well as future technologies that have not yet been created. Polkadot provides convenience for the Internet, and independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless manner through Polkadot's relay chain.
      Polkadot makes it easier than ever to create/connect decentralized applications, services and institutions. By empowering innovators to build better solutions, we seek to free society from relying on broken networks, whose large institutions cannot violate our trust.`

Anyone who has the skills or time they can contribute to Shib will be invited to help develop and advance Shib. This group has so far been responsible for logo creation, social media presence, marketing and website development. The Shib community is the core of this project and will continue to develop and expand. `
